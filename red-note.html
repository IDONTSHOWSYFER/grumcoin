                <p>
                    Contract Creation: The GRUM contract is initialized with a fixed supply of 666 million tokens. Holders are dynamically tracked, and rewards are distributed automatically based on their engagement and participation in educational activities.<br>

                </p>
            </blockquote>
            <h2 class="hell-subtitle">Contract Audit</h2>
            <blockquote class="hell-quote">
                <p>
                    A comprehensive audit of the GRUM contract was conducted by blockchain security experts, covering key areas such as:
                    <ul class="hell-list">
                        <li class="hell-item">Security of Transfer Functions: The contract’s transfer functions have been reviewed to prevent common vulnerabilities, such as reentrancy attacks. All operations are safeguarded by strict checks and balances to ensure security.</li>
                        <li class="hell-item">Reward Distribution Mechanism: The reward distribution algorithm is optimized to reward active participants based on their involvement, while ensuring that only non-rewarded holders are accounted for during each reward cycle.</li>
                        <li class="hell-item">Holder Management: The contract effectively manages holders, avoiding duplicate entries and ensuring that only active participants receive rewards. This process ensures efficient reward distribution and a smooth operational flow.</li>
                        <li class="hell-item">Utilization of OpenZeppelin Libraries: The use of OpenZeppelin’s libraries for functionalities such as Ownable and ERC-20 token standards enhances the contract’s security and robustness, especially in terms of ownership and authorization management.</li>
                    </ul>
